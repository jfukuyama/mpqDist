# Installation

The package can be installed using `devtools::install_github(jfukuyama/mpqDist)`.

# Vignettes

Vignettes showing simulations and real data analysis are available in the `vignettes` folder.
Compiled html documents from those vignettes are available in `docs`.
At this time, the html documents need to be downloaded to your machine (github doesn't display them nicely), but they are self-contained and once they are downloaded you can see all the figures and the interactive plots that are created in the vignettes.
